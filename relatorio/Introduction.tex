\section*{Introduction}
 Today's market, increasingly technological, demanding and challenging, imposes a work rhythm on companies that besides managing their core business processes, also have a significant amount of dynamics on internal activities to help them in their growth and competitiveness. In particular, companies in the information and technologies sector keep internal activities such as work fairs, knowledge sharing through informal presentations, software components development, qualification opportunities, playful activities, among others. To put these activities in practise in an efficient way, there must exist a coordination of resources that is not easy to obtain, given its allocation to ongoing projects. \par
    However, by developing a collaboration platform we can achieve a correct management of the plannings so that they can be executed in due time, and the whole process can be agiled allowing not only the registration and publication of internal needs, but also the acceptance of applications by the colaborators interested in its development. Therefore, it is intended to develop a web reactive application using the OutSystems platform, that functions as a collaboration platform designed for the management of internal corporate necessities in a company, and is accesible in all kinds of devices: browsers, tablets and smartphones.
    
    
\section*{Requirements}

In order to create a fully functional, eficient and trustworthy reactive web application that will work as a collaboration platform for companies to use, there must be a set of requirements that are predefined in due time. The understanding of the OutSystems platform and the exploration of its usability is a key factor that will provide a concise implementation of these requirements. The main requirements are described as:
  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Registration and authentication in the collaboration platform.
\item Registration of the company's internal necessities, such as the planning of events or job faires, informal meetings with the goal of sharing knowledge between employees, right medium posts, qualification offers, software components development, internal oportunities for career progress and off work activities.
\item Disclosure and calendarization of the company's necessities.
\item Application management and registration for the divulged necessities.
\item Create notifications targeting the author of the necessity when there are new applications and targeting candidates when their application has been accepted or refused, as well as uppon the application's closure.
\item Possibility of integrating the collaboration platform with Google Maps in order to mark/indicate the place for events that take place outside of the company.
\end{enumerate}
