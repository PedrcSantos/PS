    \section*{Introduction}
    Today's market, increasingly technological, demanding and challenging, imposes a work rhythm on companies that besides managing their core business processes, also have a significant amount of dynamics on internal activities to help them in their growth and competitiveness. In particular, companies in the information technologies sector, keep internal activities such as work fairs, knowledge sharing through informal presentations, software components development, qualification opportunities, playful activities, among others. To put these activities in practise in an efficient way, there must exist a way of coordinating resources that is not easy to obtain, given its allocation to ongoing projects. \par
    However, if there is a way of managing the planning in due time using a collaboration platform, the whole process can be agiled allowing not only the registration and publication of internal needs, but also the acceptance of applications by the colaborators interested in its development. Therefore, it is intended the development of an web reactive application using the OutSystems platform that functions as a collaboration platform designed for the management of internal corporate necessities in a company and is accesible in all kinds of devices: browsers, tablets and smartphones.
